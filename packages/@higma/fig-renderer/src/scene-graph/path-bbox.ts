/**
 * @file Compute the axis-aligned bounding box of a list of `PathContour`s.
 *
 * Background: paths emitted by Figma's vector network do **not** start
 * at (0, 0). The vector node's `transform.m02 / m12` already places the
 * path in user space, and the path's commands carry coordinates in the
 * vector's *local* frame whose origin is the path's bbox top-left
 * relative to the node — but that bbox is **not** itself anchored at
 * (0, 0). For example, a small icon-style VECTOR may have a stored size
 * of 19.88×19.87 yet its first path command sits at (~14, ~4); the
 * actual bbox spans (-0.06, -1.07) → (19.94, 18.93).
 *
 * `linearGradientAttrs` and `radialGradientAttrs` need this bbox to
 * convert paint.transform's normalized coordinates into pixel
 * endpoints — the gradient's normalized origin (0, 0) maps to bbox
 * top-left, not to path-local (0, 0). Without the bbox the gradient
 * sits inside an arbitrary frame and shifts away from the path it's
 * supposed to fill, producing off-axis colour bands on gradient-painted
 * VECTOR contours.
 *
 * The bbox returned here is computed from the path commands' control
 * points (an outer-bound approximation of the curve, not the tight
 * extremum). For Figma-emitted paths the cubic Bezier control points
 * are typically near the curve, so the over-approximation is small;
 * paint.transform's `m02 / m12` already account for the offset Figma
 * expects, so we mirror the same bbox semantic Figma uses internally.
