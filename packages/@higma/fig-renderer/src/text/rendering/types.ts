/**
 * @file TextRendering — SoT domain object for a fully resolved TEXT node
 *
 * A TextRendering represents the final, backend-agnostic form of a Figma TEXT
 * node after:
 *   1. Property extraction (font, size, alignment, CPA/override-resolved chars).
 *   2. Selection of rendering strategy: pre-outlined glyph contours (from
 *      Figma's derivedTextData) OR line-based rendering via font measurement.
 *   3. Layout resolution (line positions, baseline math, alignment).
 *   4. Fill color/opacity resolution.
 *
 * Every renderer (SVG, React, WebGL) consumes this single shape rather than
 * re-deriving any of it. Renderer-specific formatting (SVG attributes,
 * React JSX, WebGL tessellation) happens in the thin render layers on top.
