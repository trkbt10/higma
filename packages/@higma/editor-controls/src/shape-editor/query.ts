 * grow the stack before each visit and trim it after via the shape's
 * depth vs the stack length recorded against the last seen shape.
 *
 * Because `dfsById`'s `onVisit` fires for every node regardless of
 * match, we capture the ancestor trail of the matching node by
 * restarting the stack at each root and appending/popping as visits
 * enter/leave groups. The primitive's DFS is left-first pre-order, so
 * we maintain a parallel cursor: push on group entry (pre-descent),
 * pop on return — detected by tracking which children have been
 * entered.
