/**
 * @file SoT: resolve a `FigGuid` against a flat `symbolMap`.
 *
 * This file holds the **single** algorithm the codebase uses to look
 * a SYMBOL up in the parsed file's `symbolMap` — exact
 * `"sessionID:localID"` key match, no fallback.
 *
 * The previous implementation also performed a localID-suffix scan
 * to "survive cross-file paste residue and stale session ids."
 * Calibration across the production fixture corpus showed zero fires;
 * the fallback only ever triggered from a single unit test that
 * constructed an artificial sessionID-mismatch input to exercise it.
 * Per the project policy of "don't guess; resolve correctly or drop"
 * the fallback was deleted along with that test.
