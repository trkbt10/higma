/**
 * @file SoT for the world→backing-pixel scale that effect shaders need.
 *
 * FBO-based effects (drop shadow, inner shadow, layer blur, background
 * blur) render the silhouette into a backing-buffer-sized framebuffer
 * with the full world transform applied, then post-process it in
 * texCoord space using uniforms expressed in **backing-buffer pixels**:
 *
 *   - radius / spread (scalar) — Gaussian blur radius, alpha-morphology
 *     spread in pixels
 *   - offset (vector) — drop / inner shadow displacement in pixels
 *
 * The source data on the effect is in **world units** (Figma document
 * coordinates). Two conversions stack between those two spaces:
 *
 *   1. world → screen (CSS pixels) — the composed world transform
 *      `m00..m11`. Viewport zoom and any per-node scale/rotation are
 *      already baked into this matrix at the render call site.
 *   2. screen → backing buffer — `pixelRatio` (devicePixelRatio with
 *      higma's zoom-aware policy).
 *
 * Multiplying only by `pixelRatio` — as the effects renderer used to —
 * silently drops the world→screen factor, so at viewport zoom 200% a
 * drop shadow's offset and blur radius stay at their 100%-zoom
 * backing-pixel size while the shape itself doubles. The shadow then
 * detaches from the shape's apparent geometry as the user zooms.
 *
 * This module exposes the resolved scale as a single value object so
 * callers (and tests) cannot reintroduce the mix-up: the effect
 * renderer consumes `EffectBackingScale` and never sees `pixelRatio`
 * directly for these conversions.
